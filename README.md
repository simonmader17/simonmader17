# Hallo ðŸ‘‹

My name is Simon. I am 20 years old and graduated from the HTL St. PÃ¶lten (Computer Science) with excellent results in the school year 2020/21. The focus in school was on Java Spring Development, Algorithmics and Database Design. Privately, I enjoy automating processes using Python and developing web apps using JavaScript frameworks like React.

I am currently studying Software & Information Engineering at the Vienna University of Technology. :student:
